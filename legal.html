          <h2><b>Fact #1</b></h2>
          <p>
            The tallest living man is 37-year-old Sultan Kosen, from Turkey, who
            is 8 feet, 2.8 inches, who set the record in 2009. His growth is
            also due to a pituitary issue.
          </p>
          <h2><b>Fact #2</b></h2>
          <p>
            Experiments in universities have actually been carried out to figure
            out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop,
            both with machine and human lickers (because this is important
            scientific knowledge!). The results ranged from 252 to 411.
